DJANGO FOR BEGINNERS:

CHAPTER 1:

Virtual Environment : python -m venv <name_of_env> 

python -m venv .venv

Once created, a virtual environment must be activated. On Windows, there is a
one-time additional step of setting an Execution Policy to enable running scripts.

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

Then get into the virtual environment: 
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

To create a new project (called Django project) :

Inside the folder helloworld:

(.venv) $ django-admin startproject django_project .


To Launch the built in server:

(.venv) $ python manage.py runserver
